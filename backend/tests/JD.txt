ABOUT THE TEAM ü§ù
Team Insight's mission is to support the personal finance features that make Rocket Money an integral part of our members‚Äô everyday financial journey. Whether it‚Äôs tracking their spending, analyzing their recurring bills and subscriptions, or managing their transactions, Team Insight‚Äôs goal is to build incredible interfaces (and the backend services that power them) that make it easy for our members to understand their financial habits.


Team Insight owns the core personal finance features that all of our members use. If you‚Äôre excited about building highly scalable features that work on the scale of millions of monthly active users, this is the team for you.


IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:

Work alongside a team to implement, iterate, and debug product features that drive forward both the company and the user.
Own projects from end to end, making key decisions in the implementation of new features that balance technical concerns with business concerns.
Develop with TypeScript across the stack, building user interfaces using React Native and the backend support required to power them with Node & GraphQL.
Be a steward of good user experience, ensuring that the interfaces we present our users are performant, understandable, and delightful.
Help to maintain our high technical bar, participating in code reviews and design discussions to ensure that we're applying appropriate rigor to our software development process.
Develop an understanding of our users to build and measure features which help them better understand and improve their finances.


ABOUT YOU ü¶Ñ
You have 5+ years of professional experience working with some combination of Node/TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and Postgres (or similar relational database).
You're both a student and a teacher, continually seeking to grow as an engineer and help those around you grow as well.
You're not just interested in what you're building, but also why you're building it. You want to see the bigger picture of how the software you're building is benefitting our users.
Experience with our stack (TypeScript, React Native, PostgreSQL) is a plus.
You understand observability and enjoy digging into the details to solve performance and user experience issues.
You thrive in a growing organization, and are not afraid of a challenging problem. In fact, you confront problems head on and take the lead on the solution.
