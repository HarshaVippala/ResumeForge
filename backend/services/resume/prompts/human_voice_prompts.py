You're Harsha at a tech networking event. A senior engineer from {company} asks: "Tell me about yourself and what you do."

Your natural, authentic response should be conversational but professional.

CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
- They're hiring for: {role}
- They mentioned these technologies: {', '.join(keywords[:4])}
- You want to show relevant experience without sounding scripted

YOUR AUTHENTIC BACKGROUND:
{base_content.get('summary', '')}

REAL ACHIEVEMENTS TO MENTION:
- 7-Eleven mobile checkout platform ($500K monthly sales across 60+ stores)
- EBT payment integration (15% increase in mobile orders)
- API optimization (40% response time improvement)
- 5 years of full-stack development experience

NATURAL CONVERSATION STYLE:
✓ "I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience..."
✓ "Currently I'm working on [specific project]..."
✓ "I specialize in [relevant to their needs]..."
✓ Use first person ("I", "my", "I've")
✓ Include specific metrics that show impact
✓ Technical details that demonstrate expertise

AVOID RESUME-SPEAK:
✗ "Proven track record of..."
✗ "Responsible for developing..."
✗ "Highly motivated professional..."

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- 240-360 characters total (including spaces)
- 2-3 natural sentences
- Include {len(keywords[:4])} relevant keywords: {', '.join(keywords[:4])}
- Sound like you're actually talking to someone

Generate 3 variations with different conversational styles.

You're explaining your work achievement to a fellow engineer over coffee. Tell the story naturally.

CONVERSATION STARTER:
"What's something cool you built recently?"

YOUR STORY TO TELL:
{achievement_data}

AUTHENTIC CONTEXT:
- Company: {experience_context.get('company', 'Current company')}
- Role: {experience_context.get('role', 'Software Engineer')}
- Technologies used: {experience_context.get('technologies', [])}

KEYWORDS TO NATURALLY INCLUDE: {', '.join(keywords[:2])}

STORYTELLING STYLE:
✓ "So we had this challenge where..."
✓ "I decided to..." / "My approach was..."
✓ "The result was..." / "We ended up..."
✓ First person perspective
✓ Technical details that show expertise
✓ Specific numbers and metrics
✓ Problem → Solution → Impact flow

AVOID THESE PATTERNS (already used):
{existing_patterns}

AVOID RESUME-SPEAK:
✗ "Responsible for..."
✗ "Utilized advanced..."
✗ "Leveraged cutting-edge..."

SPACE CONSTRAINTS:
- Preferred: 1 line (130 characters)
- Acceptable: 2 lines (260 characters, use 90%+ of second line)
- Must sound natural, not cramped

EXAMPLES OF NATURAL FLOW:
✓ "Built Node.js microservices for 7-Eleven's mobile checkout, handling $500K monthly sales across 60+ stores"
✓ "Integrated EBT payments with Forage API, adding tax exemptions and split tender support that boosted mobile orders 15%"

Organize the "{section_name}" section as you would naturally describe your tech stack to another engineer.

NATURAL CONVERSATION:
"What technologies do you work with in {section_name.lower()}?"

CURRENT SKILLS: {current_skills}
JOB-RELEVANT KEYWORDS TO INCLUDE: {', '.join(keywords[:6])}

NATURAL ORGANIZATION:
✓ Most frequently used technologies first
✓ Group related techs together (React/Redux, AWS/Lambda)
✓ Use common abbreviations (JavaScript→JS, TypeScript→TS)
✓ Version numbers only if they matter
✓ Flow from primary to secondary technologies

CONSTRAINTS:
- Exactly 1 line (max 75 characters)
- Comma-separated format
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Maintain logical grouping

EXAMPLES:
✓ "Node.js, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, MongoDB" (primary stack)
✓ "AWS Lambda, S3, EC2, CloudFormation, Docker" (cloud tools)
✓ "Jest, Cypress, Jenkins, Git, Postman" (dev tools)
