# API Endpoint Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals significant gaps between the frontend's expected API endpoints and the backend implementation. Approximately **45% of expected endpoints are missing**, resulting in broken features across the application. The most critical issues affect resume generation, library management, and email integration.

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Fully Implemented Endpoints ‚úÖ

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/analyze-job` | ‚úÖ Working | Core job analysis functionality |
| `/api/parse-linkedin-job` | ‚úÖ Working | LinkedIn job parsing |
| `/api/tailor-resume-complete` | ‚úÖ Working | Complete resume tailoring |
| `/api/export-simple-resume` | ‚úÖ Working | Basic resume export |
| `/api/jobs` | ‚úÖ Working | Job listing endpoint |
| `/api/jobs/[id]` | ‚úÖ Working | Individual job details |
| `/api/jobs/stats` | ‚úÖ Working | Job statistics |
| `/api/jobs/filters` | ‚úÖ Working | Job filtering options |
| `/api/jobs/save` | ‚úÖ Working | Save job functionality |
| `/api/jobs/saved` | ‚úÖ Working | Retrieve saved jobs |
| `/api/health` | ‚úÖ Working | Health check endpoint |

### 2. Missing Endpoints ‚ùå

| Endpoint | Impact | Broken Feature |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| `/api/llm-providers` | Medium | LLM provider selection |
| `/api/generate-section` | **HIGH** | Section-by-section resume generation |
| `/api/export-resume` | **HIGH** | Full resume export (note: similar endpoint exists as `export-simple-resume`) |
| `/api/resume-library/*` | **HIGH** | Entire resume library feature |
| `/api/jobs/scrape` | **HIGH** | Job scraping automation |
| `/api/service-status` | Low | Service monitoring (duplicate of `/api/health`) |
| `/api/send-email` | Medium | Email notifications |
| `/api/email/sync` | **HIGH** | Email integration |
| `/api/email/activities` | **HIGH** | Email activity tracking |

### 3. Architectural Issues üîß

#### a. API Contract Mismatch
- **Problem**: Frontend expects `/api/export-resume` but backend implements `/api/export-simple-resume`
- **Impact**: Export functionality may be broken or using wrong endpoint

#### b. External Service Direct Access
- **Problem**: Frontend directly calls `localhost:5001` for email service
- **Impact**: 
  - Security risk (API keys exposed to client)
  - CORS issues in production
  - Breaks Backend-for-Frontend pattern

#### c. Mock Data Usage
- **Problem**: Resume Library page uses hardcoded mock data
- **Impact**: Feature appears functional but has no backend integration

## Feature Impact Analysis

### 1. Resume Generation üö® **CRITICAL**
- **Broken**: Section-by-section generation (`/api/generate-section`)
- **Working**: Complete resume generation only
- **User Impact**: Limited flexibility in resume creation

### 2. Resume Library üö® **CRITICAL**
- **Broken**: All CRUD operations
- **Current State**: Using mock data only
- **User Impact**: Cannot save, retrieve, or manage resumes

### 3. Job Scraping ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
- **Broken**: Automated job scraping (`/api/jobs/scrape`)
- **Working**: Manual job operations
- **User Impact**: Cannot automatically populate job board

### 4. Email Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
- **Broken**: All email sync and activity tracking
- **Current State**: Frontend attempts to call external service directly
- **User Impact**: No email integration features work

### 5. Service Monitoring ‚ÑπÔ∏è **LOW**
- **Issue**: Naming mismatch (`/api/service-status` vs `/api/health`)
- **Impact**: Minor - health monitoring works but uses different endpoint

## Root Causes

1. **No API Contract Enforcement**: Frontend and backend evolved independently
2. **Incomplete Migration**: TypeScript migration left some endpoints unimplemented
3. **Lack of Integration Testing**: Missing endpoints weren't caught in CI/CD
4. **Architectural Drift**: External services added without proper BFF pattern

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Fix Naming Mismatches**:
   - Rename `/api/export-simple-resume` to `/api/export-resume` OR
   - Update frontend to use correct endpoint name
   - Standardize on `/api/health` (remove `/api/service-status` references)

2. **Create Stub Endpoints**:
   - Add all missing endpoints returning `501 Not Implemented`
   - Prevents frontend crashes from 404 errors

### High Priority (This Week)
1. **Implement Critical Endpoints**:
   - `/api/generate-section` - Core feature
   - `/api/resume-library` endpoints - Core feature
   - `/api/jobs/scrape` - Important automation

2. **Fix Email Service Architecture**:
   - Create `/api/email/sync` and `/api/email/activities` in Next.js
   - These should proxy to the external email service
   - Remove direct `localhost:5001` calls from frontend

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Complete Remaining Endpoints**:
   - `/api/llm-providers`
   - `/api/send-email`

2. **Add Integration Tests**:
   - Test that verifies all endpoints in `api.config.ts` exist
   - Add to CI/CD pipeline to prevent future drift

### Long-term Architecture (Future)
1. **Consider API Contract Solution**:
   - **Option A**: tRPC for internal TypeScript APIs (recommended for this project)
   - **Option B**: OpenAPI/Swagger for more traditional REST approach
   
2. **Implement Proper BFF Pattern**:
   - All external service calls go through Next.js backend
   - No direct external service access from frontend

## Testing Checklist

To verify fixes, test these user flows:
- [ ] Generate resume section by section
- [ ] Export resume in multiple formats
- [ ] Save resume to library
- [ ] Retrieve saved resumes
- [ ] Edit existing resumes
- [ ] Trigger job scraping
- [ ] View email activities
- [ ] Check service health status

## Conclusion

The application has significant API gaps affecting core functionality. The resume library and email integration features are completely non-functional, while resume generation has limited capabilities. Immediate action is required to restore full functionality.

Priority should be given to:
1. Fixing critical missing endpoints
2. Implementing proper BFF pattern for external services
3. Establishing API contract enforcement to prevent future drift
