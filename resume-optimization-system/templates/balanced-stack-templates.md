## Key Principles for Balanced Templates

### 1. **Emphasis Through Ordering**
- Primary skills listed first in each category
- Secondary skills included but positioned after main focus
- Maintain complete skill representation

### 2. **Strategic Language**
- "Specializing in [primary] with expertise in [secondary]"
- "Strong foundation in [secondary] enabling [primary focus]"
- "Comprehensive experience across [all technologies]"

### 3. **Achievement Framing**
- Lead with primary technology achievements
- Include secondary technology context naturally
- Show how diverse skills complement main focus

### 4. **Complete Representation**
- Never hide relevant experience
- Position all skills as assets
- Show progression and adaptability

### 5. **Natural Integration**
- Secondary technologies appear in achievement descriptions
- Skills complement rather than compete
- Present as strategic technology choices

## Usage Strategy

1. **Choose primary focus** based on job requirements
2. **Reorder skills** to emphasize target technologies
3. **Adjust language** to highlight specialization while maintaining breadth
4. **Select achievements** that showcase primary focus
5. **Include secondary technologies** naturally in descriptions

This approach ensures you're clearly aligned with the role while demonstrating the full value of your diverse technical background.
