# Resume Customization Guide

## 15-Minute Resume Customization Workflow

This guide shows you how to quickly customize your resume for any job application using the Impact Repository system.

## Step 1: Job Description Analysis (3 minutes)

### 1.1 Create Analysis Document
Copy this template and fill it out for each job:

```markdown
# JD Analysis: [Company Name] - [Job Title]
Date: [Today's Date]
Job Posting URL: [Link if available]

## Core Requirements (Must-Have)
### Technical Skills
- [ ] Requirement 1 → My Achievement ID: [e.g., 7E_MCO_PLATFORM]
- [ ] Requirement 2 → My Achievement ID: [e.g., LM_GRAPHQL_APIS]
- [ ] Requirement 3 → My Achievement ID: [e.g., 7E_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION]

### Experience Areas
- [ ] Experience Type 1 → My Achievement ID: [e.g., 7E_EBT_INTEGRATION]
- [ ] Experience Type 2 → My Achievement ID: [e.g., LM_INTERN_LEADERSHIP]

## Nice-to-Have
- [ ] Preferred Skill 1 → My Experience: [Brief note]
- [ ] Preferred Skill 2 → My Experience: [Brief note]

## Company Analysis
### Keywords Found
- Primary: [main technical terms repeated multiple times]
- Secondary: [supporting terms and phrases]

### Company Values/Culture
- [What they emphasize about their culture]
- [How they position themselves in their industry]
- [Any specific language they use repeatedly]

## Customization Priority
1. [Most critical achievement to highlight]
2. [Second most important]
3. [Third most important]
```

### 1.2 Quick Analysis Tips
- **Look for repeated keywords** - These are usually most important
- **Note the order** - Requirements listed first typically matter more
- **Distinguish must-haves from nice-to-haves**
- **Check company about/careers pages** for additional context

## Step 2: Achievement Selection (5 minutes)

### 2.1 Query Your Impact Repository
Based on your JD analysis, find matching achievements:

**For Backend Roles**, prioritize:
- `7E_MCO_PLATFORM` (scalable architecture)
- `7E_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION` (performance tuning)
- `LM_SERVERLESS_PLATFORM` (serverless experience)
- `LM_GRAPHQL_APIS` (API development)

**For Full-Stack Roles**, prioritize:
- `7E_MCO_PLATFORM` (end-to-end platform)
- `LM_UI_UPDATES` (frontend experience)
- `LM_FRONTEND_REFACTORING` (React modernization)
- `7E_EBT_INTEGRATION` (complete feature delivery)

**For Platform/DevOps Roles**, prioritize:
- `7E_OBSERVABILITY` (monitoring/SRE)
- `7E_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION` (system optimization)
- `7E_MCO_PLATFORM` (scalable infrastructure)
- `LM_TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE` (reliability)

**For Leadership/Senior Roles**, prioritize:
- `LM_INTERN_LEADERSHIP` (team leadership)
- `7E_EBT_INTEGRATION` (project ownership)
- `LM_USER_TRACKING` (strategic initiatives)

### 2.2 Selection Criteria
For each position, select **3-4 bullets per job** based on:
1. **Direct relevance** to core requirements (highest priority)
2. **Keyword alignment** with JD language
3. **Impact level** - choose achievements with strongest metrics
4. **Uniqueness** - what differentiates you from other candidates

## Step 3: Content Assembly (4 minutes)

### 3.1 Professional Summary Update
Choose appropriate summary from templates based on role type:

**Backend Focus**:
> Software Engineer with 5 years designing and deploying scalable, cloud-native applications using Node.js, TypeScript, Python, React & AWS. Currently leading development for 7-Eleven's mobile self-checkout platform, processing thousands of orders across U.S and Canada.

**Full-Stack Focus**:
> Full-Stack Software Engineer with 5 years building end-to-end applications from React frontends to Node.js/Python backends on AWS. Experienced in payment systems, real-time processing, and microservices architecture.

**Platform/DevOps Focus**:
> Platform Engineer with 5 years optimizing cloud infrastructure and serverless architectures on AWS. Specialized in high-availability systems, performance optimization, and observability.

### 3.2 Bullet Point Selection
For each role, choose the best bullet version:

**Example for Performance-Focused Role**:
- Use `v2_technical`: "Implemented intelligent caching strategy using Redis for cart/basket data, optimized MongoDB queries with indexing, achieving 40% latency reduction"

**Example for Business-Impact Role**:
- Use `v1_impact`: "Reduced API response times by 40% and lowered MongoDB query load by caching frequently accessed cart and basket data via Redis"

### 3.3 Skills Section Reordering
Reorder skills to match job requirements:

**For Backend Role** (Node.js/Python focus):
```
Full-Stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Python, NestJS, Express.js, React • 
Cloud & DevOps: AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3), Serverless, Docker, Kubernetes •
APIs: RESTful, GraphQL, gRPC, Swagger/OpenAPI •
```

**For Frontend Role** (React focus):
```
Full-Stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, NestJS, Python • 
Frontend: JavaScript, CSS, React Hooks, Component Architecture •
Cloud & DevOps: AWS (Lambda, S3, CloudFront), Docker •
```

## Step 4: Final Review & Export (3 minutes)

### 4.1 ATS Optimization Checklist
- [ ] **Format**: Single column, standard headers, clean bullets
- [ ] **File Type**: .docx for Lever, PDF for others
- [ ] **Keywords**: Core requirements appear in summary and bullets
- [ ] **Metrics**: Each bullet has quantifiable impact where possible
- [ ] **Length**: Exactly 1 page
- [ ] **Contact Info**: Updated for target location if relevant

### 4.2 Human Reader Optimization
- [ ] **6-Second Test**: Top 1/3 clearly shows value proposition
- [ ] **Bullet Hierarchy**: Most relevant achievements first
- [ ] **Consistency**: Parallel structure across all bullets
- [ ] **Impact Focus**: Results and metrics prominently featured

### 4.3 Final Export
Save with naming convention:
- `Harsha_Vippala_[Company]_[Role]_[Date].docx`
- Example: `Harsha_Vippala_Meta_Senior_Backend_Engineer_2024-06-20.docx`

## Common Customization Patterns

### For Startup/Scale-up Roles
**Emphasize**:
- End-to-end ownership (`7E_EBT_INTEGRATION`)
- Rapid iteration (`LM_FRONTEND_REFACTORING`) 
- Performance under constraints (`7E_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION`)

### For Enterprise/Big Tech Roles
**Emphasize**:
- System scale (`7E_MCO_PLATFORM` - $500K transactions)
- Architecture depth (`LM_GRAPHQL_APIS` - 5 product lines)
- Observability/SRE (`7E_OBSERVABILITY`)

### For Payment/Fintech Roles
**Emphasize**:
- Payment systems (`7E_EBT_INTEGRATION`)
- Compliance/Security (emphasize in summaries)
- High-availability (`7E_MCO_PLATFORM` - 99.95% uptime)

### For Team Lead/Senior Roles
**Emphasize**:
- Leadership experience (`LM_INTERN_LEADERSHIP`)
- Strategic initiatives (`LM_USER_TRACKING`)
- Cross-functional impact (`7E_EBT_INTEGRATION` - nationwide rollout)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I don't have experience in [required technology]"
**Solution**: Look for transferable experience
- Similar frameworks (Vue → React)
- Adjacent technologies (REST → GraphQL)
- Emphasize learning ability in summary

### "The role requires [X years] and I have less"
**Solution**: Emphasize impact and progression
- Use achievements that show senior-level thinking
- Highlight rapid growth and learning
- Focus on results that typically require more experience

### "I can't find matching achievements"
**Solution**: Abstract and reframe
- Look at underlying skills/patterns
- Emphasize problem-solving approach
- Use transferable achievements from different domains

## Quality Assurance

### Before Submitting
1. **Read aloud** - Does it flow naturally?
2. **Keyword density** - Are main requirements mentioned 2-3 times?
3. **Metric verification** - Are all numbers accurate?
4. **Consistency check** - Do achievements align with summary?
5. **ATS test** - Copy/paste into plain text - does it parse correctly?

This workflow typically takes 15 minutes for an experienced user and 25-30 minutes when learning the system. The more you use it, the faster and more intuitive it becomes.
