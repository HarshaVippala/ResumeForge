## Template Usage Guidelines

### Choosing the Right Template:
1. **Read job description carefully** - identify primary technology requirements
2. **Match template emphasis** to job's main focus areas
3. **Consider company type** - startup vs enterprise affects language
4. **Look at team structure** - full-stack vs specialized backend roles

### Customization Strategy:
1. **Keep all technologies** but reorder by relevance
2. **Adjust summary language** to match role requirements
3. **Select achievements** that showcase primary technologies
4. **Include secondary technologies** naturally in achievement descriptions

### Quality Check:
- Does the template align with job's primary requirements?
- Are target technologies mentioned prominently in summary?
- Do skills appear in order of job relevance?
- Are achievements selected to showcase target stack?
- Is secondary experience included without overwhelming primary focus?

## Quick Selection Guide

**For Java Backend roles** → Template B1
**For Node.js Backend roles** → Template B2  
**For Python Backend roles** → Template B3
**For React + Node.js Full-Stack** → Template F1
**For React + Python Full-Stack** → Template F2
**For Next.js focused roles** → Template F3
**For Frontend-heavy Full-Stack** → Template F4

Each template maintains your complete technical breadth while strategically emphasizing the technologies most relevant to your target role.
